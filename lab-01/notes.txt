Lab 01 - Username enumeration via different responses

End Goal: Login with correct username and password

Analysis:

1. Figure out the correct username

Enumerate the different usernames with some dummy password to find out which username exists.
Use the given list of usernames in the lab then brute force these usernames.
Once we get an error message that says "Incorrect password", we'll know that the username is correct, but the password is wrong.

2. Figure out the correct password

With the same username as step 1, we now enumerate the password field with the given list of passwords in the lab.
Once we receive a status code of 302, we will have successfully logged in and have completed the lab.
(or, when "Incorrect password" is NOT in the response text)
