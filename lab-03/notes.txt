Lab 03 - Password reset broken logic

End goal: Exploit password reset functionality to reset Carlos' password

Given information:

Your credentials: wiener:peter
Victim's username: carlos

Approach:

Open the web application in the Burp Suite Browser to log the HTTP requests in the Proxy -> HTTP history tab

1. Login with username "wiener" and password "peter" to test
2. Logout
3. Click Forgot Password and enter "wiener", then reset the password to "password"
4. Send the following URI to Repeater /forgot-password?temp-forgot-password-token=<TOKEN>
5. In the Request tab, change the username from wiener to carlos to change carlos' password to "password"
6. Login with username "carlos" and password "password" in the browser
7. Done

Where is the vulnerability?
- It is in the implemenation of the forgot password functionality.
- It checks if the temp-forgot-password-token parameter are the same or not.
    - If yes, it allows you to reset any user account's password
- It doesn't actually check to see if this is a valid temporary forgot password token and that that token
is linked to the user that is requesting the password reset.
