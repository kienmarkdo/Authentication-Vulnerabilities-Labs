Lab 06 - Username enumeration via account lock

End goal: Exploit logic flaw to enumerate valid username and then brute-force user's password.

Given information:
- Candidate usernames
- Candidate passwords

Problem:
- In the last lab, we get locked out by our IP address.
- In this lab, we get locked out by the account.
- No other hints are given.

Analysis:

1. Try out a random username and password, then click login several times
    - If this username gets locked out, then this username exists.
    - If this username doesn't get locked out, then this username does not exist.
    - Try asdfsadfasdf:asdfsadfasdf in Burp Repeater.
        - "Invalid username or password" message after 10 login attempts.
        - This username therefore does not exist.

2. Find the valid username via username enumeration
    - In Burp Intruder (or Python script), try logging in with the username list 5 times each.
    - If one particular username receives a "your account has been locked out due to too many attempts", we'll know that that username exists
        - <username>:testpassword

3. Find the username's password and login via password enumeration
    - Try logging in with all of the passwords from the passwords list with the username found in the previous step.
    - If a username:password combination is valid, there will be no error message.
    - This is due to a backend logic flaw.
    - It should continue to lock the login attempt regardless of whether the username/password is correct or not.
        Otherwise, the lock is useless, because when I get the correct password, it still logs in/displays a different error message.

NOTE: This lab can be completed with Burp Intruder - Cluster Bomb. However, since I only have the Burp Community Edition, I will write my own Python script.

Once the script determines the password, wait a minute until the lockout expires, then login with these credentials.
